Repositories
________________________________________________________________________________

As repositories can be stored anywhere (and retrieved via any means) one may
find it difficult to locate them. This page aims to partially solve this issue
by providing a curated list of third party repositories.

Listing every repository is not feasible as a complete list can never exist.
Further, the wheat must be separated from the chaff as not all repositories
are well maintained or of a high quality.

[001] Curated Repository List
________________________________________________________________________________

Repositories in the list below complement and build upon the distribution.
They are well maintained and of adequate quality. This list is very new and does
not yet contain many repositories. Send suggestions for inclusion to #/contact


--[002] kiss-llvm --------------------------------------------------------------

  This is a kiss-compliant repository structure to build LLVM without any traces
  of GCC libraries. It also provides any alternatives for official KISS packages
  that cannot be built in an LLVM-only environment as is.
