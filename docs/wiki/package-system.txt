KISS Package System
________________________________________________________________________________

Packages are comprised of a directory and the series of files contained within.
The name of the package is derived from its directory name. The files which
comprise the system are as follows.

+------------------+----------+------------+----------+-------------+----------+
| File             | Language | Executable | Comments | Blank lines | Required |
+------------------+----------+------------+----------+-------------+----------+
|                  |          |            |          |             |          |
| build            | Any      | Yes [2]    | N/A      | N/A         | Yes      |
| checksums        | DSL [3]  | No         | No       | No          | No [1]   |
| depends          | DSL [3]  | No         | Yes      | Yes         | No       |
| sources          | DSL [3]  | No         | Yes      | Yes         | No       |
| version          | DSL [3]  | No         | [4]      | [4]         | Yes      |
|                  |          |            |          |             |          |
| pre-remove       | Any      | Yes [2]    | N/A      | N/A         | No       |
| post-install     | Any      | Yes [2]    | N/A      | N/A         | No       |
|                  |          |            |          |             |          |
+------------------+----------+------------+----------+-------------+----------+

Unless stated otherwise, all files marked DSL are a grid of cells split into
rows by newline and columns by whitespace.

[1] The checksums file is only required if the sources file contains sources
    which exist as files on disk (directories, git repositories need not apply).

[2] The only requirement is that the file be executable. The file itself can be
    written in any programming language.

[3] The file's format is a domain specific language with its own rules.
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language

[4] Tooling should only read the first line of the version file. Any lines
    following should be ignored (allowing one to store arbitrary information).

[001] build
________________________________________________________________________________

The build file is executed in the directory containing the package's extracted
sources. Unlike other distributions, a 'cd' is not needed as sources have their
top-level directory components stripped away.

The build file is given two arguments. The destination directory (where
artifacts should be installed) and the first field of the package's version
file (verbatim).

The build file is given a modified environment containing DESTDIR, KISS_ROOT,
GOPATH and generic defaults for toolchain variables (if unset by the user). The
toolchain defaults are as follows: AR=ar, CC=cc, CXX=c++, NM=nm, RANLIB=ranlib

[002] checksums
________________________________________________________________________________

The checksums file is generated by the package manager (kiss c pkg) and is
derived from files listed in the package's sources file. Directories and Git
repositories are excluded.

Checksum verification can be disabled for a source by replacing its checksum
with 'SKIP' in the checksums file. The package manager will notify you when
this occurs.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                              |

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


[003] depends
________________________________________________________________________________

The depends file contains the package's dependencies listed one per line in
alphabetical order. Duplicate entries are not supported. The second optional
field denotes the dependency type (unset for runtime, 'make' for compile-time).

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                              |

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


[004] sources
________________________________________________________________________________

The sources file contains the package's sources one per line. A valid source is
a URL to a file, relative path, absolute path or Git repository. The optional
second field denotes the relative destination directory.

Git repositories must be prefixed with git+. An optional suffix is supported to
checkout a specific branch (@BRANCH) or commit (#COMMIT). All clones are shallow
where supported by the remote server. If no suffix is used, master is cloned.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The following MARKERS can be used to substitute version information. These are
replaced at runtime with their respective values. Literal MARKERS can be escaped
by prepending a backslash.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                              |

|    MAJOR   The first  component of VERSION split on .-_+                     |
|    MINOR   The second component of VERSION split on .-_+                     |
|    PATCH   The third  component of VERSION split on .-_+                     |
|    IDENT   All other components.                                             |

|                                                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


[005] version
________________________________________________________________________________

The version file is a single line split into two mandatory fields. The first
field is the package's version and the second field the version of the
repository files themselves.

If the package follows its upstream release schedule, the first field should
match the upstream version number. If the source is a Git repository, the
version should be set to 'git'. If a specific git commit is used, the version
number should match accordingly.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                                              |

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


[006] pre-remove
________________________________________________________________________________

The pre-remove file is executed before removal of the package. This file should
be used to perform any required pre-removal steps or to display notices.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+


[007] post-install
________________________________________________________________________________

The post-install file is executed after installation of the package. This file
should be used to perform any required post-install steps or to display notices.

+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
